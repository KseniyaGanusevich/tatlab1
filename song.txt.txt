The thoughts inside my head
I think it's time to let them out
No question on which way to go
It doesn't matter now
I take a step, whichever destination
I'll be runnin'
Tighten up my laces
'Cause I'm ready to be movin'
 
Now I'm free, get up
I know that I can go anywhere
Free, get up
You be surprised I'll be everywhere
Free, get out
Anywhere now I don't even care
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da
 
Straighten up your posture and walk
'Cause in the end you're unstoppable
Stand up wherever you go
You'll make it with no trouble
Dramatic cutscene every scene is the best of the best
'Cause my life is a five star movie
I'm not done yet so
 
Tight-tight, go brace yourself
I tighten my double knot
I tighten my double knot
Stray Kids
 
Anywhere I go now, go, go
My decision, my life, go, go
Anywhere I go now, go, go
The way I wanna go
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da

Blank sided dice, no sided coin
Wherever it points
Now it doesn't matter
'Cause I'm following the broken compass in the void
Even if you think you can't get enough
One out of a hundred is just good enough, yuh
Mix every single color
Only just to watch it all end up black
 
Now I'm free, get up
I know that I can go anywhere
Free, get up
You be surprised I'll be everywhere
Free, get out
Anywhere now I don't even care
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da
 
I've been lookin' at a destination
Suddenly my vision kept on getting wider
Looked around to see the many ways and possibilites
I keep getting stronger
Go, break all the, break all the rules (Ah)
Don't care about anything (Blah)
I do whatever I want so
 
Tight-tight, go brace yourself
I tighten my double knot
I tighten my double knot
Stray Kids
 
Anywhere I go now, go, go
My decision, my life, go, go
Anywhere I go now, go, go
The way I wanna go
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da
 
Don't even matter, ayy, ayy
Wherever I go, ayy, ayy
Whatever happens
I'ma do what I want
 
Ooh, double knot
Woo, double knot
Hey, go, go, go, go
Hey, go, go, double knot
